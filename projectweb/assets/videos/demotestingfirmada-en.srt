1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:13,800
Tests are started from console with "mvn test"

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:21,650
Tests are launched within a  xvfb session, which is a software that emulates a hardware-less X server

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:21,600
The Xfvb is in the background and it is headless by default.
Nevertheless, its output can be captured and made visible through VNC

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:32,250
The GUI under testing is launched from a terminal by indicating that the DISPLAY is the new one run by Xfvb.
This is easy from linux with the commands "env DISPLAY=:1 whatevercommand"

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,200
FEST framework is used to simulate user actions

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:36,450
FEST injects events into the GUI such as mouse movements or key press/release actions

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:43,100
Events are not launched over X associated to some raw X,Y position.
Instead, they are focused into concrete GUI components, so the testing code is quite more readable.

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:48,650
Tests include creation of entities, checking there are elements in the diagrams matching the expected names of created elements,
text input, GUI state (e.g. enable/disabled), and others
