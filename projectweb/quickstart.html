INGENIAS is the name of an Agent Oriented Software Engineering
 Methodology. It is supported by the INGENIAS Development Kit. This
tutorial will introduce how to use this kit to develop a simple
Multi-Agent System. In general, a MAS in INGENIAS will have a
specification made with the INGENIAS MAS modeling language, a set of
Java files (some of them automatically generated) and resources
(images, html, etc.).


All the artifacts being part of the INGENIAS support tools are
already uploaded to the <a target="_blank" title="Maven Central Repository"
href="http://search.maven.org/">Maven central repository</a>. Also,
since INGENIAS projects are Maven projects, it is possible to include
any software available in this repository. This does not imply that
can be easily integrated, but this tutorial will give some hints. For
integrating software not available in the Maven repository, some
additional steps are required. Since these steps lead to locally
installed software, rather than the globally available software in
Maven repository, we recommend to follow sonatype instructions to
create your own Maven repository or to<a target="_blank" title="Sonatype
instructions to upload third party software"
href="http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/using-sect-uploading.
html"> upload this particular software to the official one</a>. It is
highly recommended that you include the sources for those binaries.
Besides, this alternative requires <a target="_blank" title="Instructions for
registering in Sonatype"
href="https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository
+Usage+Guide">having
registered your project in sonatype</a>.&nbsp;

There are several development scenarios considered in this
tutorial
 
- Starting a project from one template</li>
- Running a project
- Modifying a project</li>


The scenarios consider a GUI Agent. This GUI agent shows one window
having one button. The agent is behind the GUI, processing the events.
In this case, the events are button click events. The processing
consists in printing a message in the console.

# Required software

The INGENIAS requires three pieces of software which, if you are used
to develop, probably already have: Java SDK (1.6), Ant, and Maven
(v3). The MAS is built and deployed using <a target="_blank" title="Maven site"
href="http://www.maven.org">Maven</a>. The execution of the system
itself is made using <a target="_blank" title="ANT site"
href="http://ant.apache.org">ant</a>.

## Installing Java SDK

First, The Java SDK has to be installed. It needs to be the sun
version, not the openjdk.
<b>Linux</b>: just type in a console 
<code>sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk</code> 

and to be sure this is the version being executed, run

<code>sudo update-alternatives --config java</code> 

And 

<code>sudo update-alternatives --config javac</code>

In both cases, check that the java-sun-6 version is selected.

the Java SDK download and installation guide</a><a target="_blank" title="Java
SDK install instructions"
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/index-137561.html">.
</a>
 
## Installing Ant

Ant software has to be installed as well. To do so:
<b>Linux:</b> just type in a console 

<code>sudo apt-get install ant</code> 

If you install ant, you may want to use also the bash shell complete
feature. This feature permits to complete commands using the tab key. To
install this type:

<code>sudo apt-get install bash-completion</code>

the ant download and installation guide</a><a target="_blank" title="Ant
download and install instructions"
href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html">. </a>


## Installing Maven

<b>Linux</b>: just type in a console 

<code>sudo apt-get install maven3</code>
<b>
</b>
<b>Windows and others:</b> <a title="Maven download and install instructions"
href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Check the maven
download and installation guide</a>.&nbsp;

## Starting a project from one template
The example shows how to create one project. In general, to access
the project templates of INGENIAS, you have to write
<code>mvn archetype:generate</code>


And select the ingenias project among the ones shown .... which tend
to be hundreds. To make things easier, you can filter project
templates with:
<code>mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=iaf</code>


or
<code>mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=ingenias.</code>

 
Following, it is necessary to choose a groupID and an artifactID that
identifies your development. <a target="_blank" title="Maven naming conventions"
href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html">There
are some guidelines that may help to decide which names to assign to
each one</a>. For the sake of a small development, just write the
same value in both. The version number can be left as it is. It makes
sense in long term developments, though.&nbsp;

# Running the project

After creating a project, to run the software, by default the command
is:
<code>ant runProdStandAlone</code>

This command starts the system, but it may fail the first time. If you
see some exception initially, just write:
<code>mvn test; ant runProdStandAlone</code> 
The reason for the failure is that Maven needs to download the first
time a file ant needs. After this first time, you will not need to do
this again for any project, unless you delete the maven repository. 

In the video, it is shown different ways of launching the application. 
<ul>
<li>ant runXXXXProdStandAlone. It means "launching the system using an
embedded non-visible JADE instance". If there is an already opened
JADE instance, whether it is visible or not, it will connect to it
automatically.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ant runXXXX. It means, "launch the system but do not include an
embedded JADE instance". It will fail if there is no opened JADE
instance . </li>
</ul>
The XXXX stands for the name of the deployment. In INGENIAS, you can
specify how many agents you want to run, of what type, and what kind of
initial state you want to assume from them. Each deployment has a
specific name which you assign in the specification. This name replaces
the XXXX in the example.&nbsp; When there is no XXXX, it is assumed one
instance of each defined agent is launched assuming a default initial
state.

# Modifying the specification
A development is usually requiring creating or modifying a
specification. The video shows how to access the specification, how a
new deployment is defined, and how to run this new deployment.
The specification is modified using the editor. The editor is
launched with:
<code>ant edit</code>
After modifying the specification, it needs to be saved to be
considered in the execution. Then, type your preferred launch command,
like:

<code>ant run</code> 
When the specification is modified, the next time ant is invoked, it
will take longer to execute. The reason is the need to regenerate the
code for several Java classes to take into account the changes made.
