The tutorial has been updated to include relevant information for Maven users. INGENIAS elements can be found under the groupid **net.sf.ingenias** in <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7cga%7c1%7cg%3A%22net.sf.ingenias%22" target="_blank">Maven Central</a>.  The main developer is **escalope** and the packages ought to be signed. If you know about Maven, you can already use the compoments there. There are archetypes for building INGENIAS projects. The relevant archetypes are:

- *iafarch-empty*: it creates an empty project
- *iafarch-gui*: it creates a project showing how an agent can interface with a GUI
- *iafarch-helloworld*: a basic example of an agent printing hello world
- *iafarch-interaction*: a more complex example involving interaction among agents as well as inheritance properties

Sources can be found in sourceforge in <a href="http://ingenias.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ingenias/" target="_blank">http://ingenias.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ingenias</a>. The trunk/IDKMaven folder contains the development branch of INGENIAS Development Kit. Tagged versions can be found in the tags branch.
