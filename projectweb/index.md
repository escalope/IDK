INGENIAS Development Kit is a tool for developing Multi-Agent Systems that
supports the INGENIAS methodology.

![INGENIAS development schema](/assets/img/schema.png)

INGENIAS promotes a model driven approach based on the use of [INGENME](http://ingenme.sf.net). INGENME is used to produce a visual editor for Multi-Agent Systems or MAS. MAS specifications are processed to produce programming code, html documents, or other required products. INGENIAS addresses roundtrip engineering issues as well, by a concrete folder structure and a code-to-specification information migration tool. 

The software you need is Maven. Checkout the [quick start
guide](/quickstart.html) to get acquainted with these tools and start developing MAS.
