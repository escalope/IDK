The package is dedicated to communication management entities. The main one is ConversationManagement, responsible
of handling the different communication sessions among agents. The second in importance is LocksManager which creates
locks for information so that it can be transmitted before tasks operate on it and there is any risk of losing it.
There are also abstract classes which will be specialized for the definition of concrete agents. This is the case
of StateBehavior and DefaultCommControl. In other cases, there is an interface to be implemented for each agent and protocol. This is the
case of AgentProtocols and CustomLocks.
