The use of Maven for development is not just for anyone. Though the mechanics are simple, it seems that developing from console is not just for everyone. Many people still prefer having something downloaded and then opening a GUI to start working. This is the reason why I have decided to, from time to time, release the editor as a regular self-contained jar file. 

The editor is just the modeling part of INGENIAS Development Kit. [The editor will be available from sourceforge as a file](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ingenias/files/INGENIASEditor) which you can download.

To use this editor, if your OS is prepared, it should be enough with double clicking in the jar file. If your OS does not execute it, try it from command line with:

``java -jar NAME_OF_THE_EDITOR.jar``
